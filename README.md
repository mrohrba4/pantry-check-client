# PANTRY CHECK CLIENT

Pantry Check, A solution to the frustrating problem of not remembering what groceries/supplies you have. Pantry Check is a web/mobile app kinda like a shopping list, but with this you'll be able to do so much more!

### Planning Story

Pantry Check has been an idea/project I've had for quite long time due to me being forgetful while I'm out. I wanted an app that I could add/edit, view and even search for items I have at home while I'm out shopping so I won't waste a trip. I'm making it for those of us who seek to be more organized and efficient with our shopping tasks. I broke down each step to make it easier for me. I focused on the user, and the process of making an account, signing in/out and changing passwords then I moved on to the items(Adding, Viewing, Deleting, updating.)

### User Stories

- *As a New User*, I want to make an account so that I may sign in.
- *As a User*, I want to sign in, sign out, change password and manage my account.
- *As a User*, I want to add/view/delete and update my items.

### Technologies used

- Javascript
- JQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap

### Unsolved Problems

Version 1 is focused on the basic Authorization of the user, and the basic resource(item). I plan on adding a lot of other functions and features. Future features may include:

- Items organized by their location(collections), and a search function.
- A more accessible UI(with a focus on the items page), especially for mobile.
- More labels for the items(description, price, store, etc)
- A "Stores" branch, where you can add your favorite and most visited stores.
- A "Recipes" branch, where you can input, view, edit your own recipes and the ability to see if you can make that meal with the items you have.
